# House Sale Prices and Venues in Municipal Parts of Prague

### Business Problem
Prague is one of the most popular cities in Europe with many outstanding views and historic, exciting structures. In this study, I give a brief insight about the population, house prices and types by comparing municipal parts of the city for anyone to buy a property in Prague or interested in the real estate industry. I'll go over these steps;

- Observe the municipal parts of Prague
- Population distribution by municipal parts
- House prices by municipal parts
- Number of different types of venues inside 1km radius of the center of municipal parts
- Cluster municipal parts of Prague based on the venue availablitiy
